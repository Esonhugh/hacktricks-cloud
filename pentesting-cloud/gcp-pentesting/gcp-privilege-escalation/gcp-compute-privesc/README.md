## compute

### `compute.projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata`

With that permission you can **modify** the **metadata** information of an **instance** and change the **authorized keys of a user**, or **create** a **new user with sudo** permissions. Therefore, you will be able to exec via SSH into any VM instance and steal the GCP Service Account the Instance is running with.\
Limitations:

* Note that GCP Service Accounts running in VM instances by default have a **very limited scope**
* You will need to be **able to contact the SSH** server to login

For more information about how to exploit this permission check:

{% content-ref url="gcp-add-custom-ssh-metadata.md" %}
[gcp-add-custom-ssh-metadata.md](gcp-add-custom-ssh-metadata.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### `compute.instances.setMetadata`

This permission gives the **same privileges as the previous permission** but over a specific instances instead to a whole project. The **same exploits and limitations as for the previous section applies**.

### `compute.instances.setIamPolicy`

This kind of permission will allow you to **grant yourself a role with the previous permissions** and escalate privileges abusing them.

### **`compute.instances.osLogin`**

If **OSLogin is enabled in the instance**, with this permission you can just run **`gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE]`** and connect to the instance. You **won't have root privs** inside the instance.

### **`compute.instances.osAdminLogin`**

If **OSLogin is enabled in the instanc**e, with this permission you can just run **`gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE]`** and connect to the instance. You will have **root privs** inside the instance.

### `compute.instances.create`,`iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`

This method **creates a new Compute Engine instance with a specified Service Account**, then **sends the token** belonging to that Service Account to an **external server.**

The following additional **permissions are required** for this method:

* _compute.disks.create_
* _compute.instances.create_
* _compute.instances.setMetadata_
* _compute.instances.setServiceAccount_
* _compute.subnetworks.use_
* _compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp_
* _iam.serviceAccounts.actAs_

The exploit script for this method can be found [here](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/compute.instances.create.py).

### `osconfig.patchDeployments.create` | `osconfig.patchJobs.exec`

If you have the **`osconfig.patchDeployments.create`** or **`osconfig.patchJobs.exec`  **  permissions you can create a [**patch job or deployment**](https://blog.raphael.karger.is/articles/2022-08/GCP-OS-Patching). This will enable you to move laterally in the environment and gain code execution on all the compute instances within a project.

If you want to manually exploit this you will need to create either a [patch job](https://github.com/rek7/patchy/blob/main/pkg/engine/patches/patch\_job.json) or [deployment](https://github.com/rek7/patchy/blob/main/pkg/engine/patches/patch\_deployment.json) for a patch job run:

`gcloud compute os-config patch-jobs execute --file=patch.json`

To deploy a patch deployment:

`gcloud compute os-config patch-deployments create my-update --file=patch.json`

Automated tooling such as [patchy](https://github.com/rek7/patchy) exists to detect lax permissions and automatically move laterally.

**You can also abuse this for persistence.**

### `compute.machineImages.get`, (`compute.machineImages.create`)

(not tested) With the first permission, it's possible to **download a machine image**. With the second one, you could **create an image of an instance and download it**.\
The goal of downloading machines images is to **search for sensitive information on them**.

### `compute.machineImages.setIamPolicy`

Use this permission to **get the previous permissions.**

### `compute.snapshots.get`, (`compute.disks.createSnapshot`,`compute.snapshots.create`)

(not tested) With the first permission, it's possible to **download the snapshot**. With the second one, you could **create a snapshot of a disk and download it**.\
The goal of downloading snapshots is to **search for sensitive information on them**.

TODO: Check which permission is the one that grants permissions to create snapshots.

### `compute.snapshots.setIamPolicy`

Use this permission to **get the previous permissions.**

### `compute.disks.use`, `compute.disks.useReadOnly`

`TOOD`

### `compute.disks.setIamPolicy`

`TODO`

### `compute.disks.addResourcePolicies`

`TODO`
