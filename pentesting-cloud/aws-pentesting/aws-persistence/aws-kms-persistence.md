## KMS

For mor information check:

{% content-ref url="../../aws-security/aws-services/aws-kms-enum.md" %}
[aws-kms-enum.md](../../aws-security/aws-services/aws-kms-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Grant acces via KMS policies

An attacker could use the permission **`kms:PutKeyPolicy`** to **give access** to a key to a user under his control or even to an external account. Check the [**KMS Privesc page**](../../aws-security/aws-privilege-escalation/aws-kms-privesc.md) for more information.

### Eternal Grant

Grants are another way to give a principal some permissions over a specific key. It's possible to give a grant that allows a user to create grants. Moreover, a user can have several grant (even identical) over the same key.

Therefore, it's possible for a user to have 10 grants with all the permissions. The attacker should monitor this constantly. And if at some point 1 grant is removed another 10 should be generated.

(We are using 10 and not 2 to be able to detect that a grant was removed while the user still has some grant)

```bash
# To generate grants, generate 10 like this one
aws kms create-grant \
    --key-id <key-id> \
    --grantee-principal <user_arn> \
    --operations "CreateGrant" "Decrypt"

# To monitor grants
aws kms list-grants --key-id <key-id>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
A grant can give permissions only from this et: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#terms-grant-operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#terms-grant-operations)
