in this scenario we are going to suppose that you **have compromised a non privilege account** inside a VM in a Compute Engine project.

Amazingly, GPC permissions of the compute engine you have compromised may help you to **escalate privileges locally inside a machine**. Even if that won't always be very helpful in a cloud environment, it's good to know it's possible.

## Read the scripts <a href="#follow-the-scripts" id="follow-the-scripts"></a>

**Compute Instances** are probably there to **execute some scripts** to perform actions with their service accounts.

As IAM is go granular, an account may have **read/write** privileges over a resource but **no list privileges**.

A great hypothetical example of this is a Compute Instance that has permission to read/write backups to a storage bucket called `instance82736-long-term-xyz-archive-0332893`.

Running `gsutil ls` from the command line returns nothing, as the service account is lacking the `storage.buckets.list` IAM permission. However, if you ran `gsutil ls gs://instance82736-long-term-xyz-archive-0332893` you may find a complete filesystem backup, giving you clear-text access to data that your local Linux account lacks.

You may be able to find this bucket name inside a script (in bash, Python, Ruby...).

## Custom Metadata

Administrators can add [custom metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata#custom) at the **instance** and **project level**. This is simply a way to pass **arbitrary key/value pairs into an instance**, and is commonly used for environment variables and startup/shutdown scripts.

Moreover, it's possible to add **userdata**, which is a script that will be **executed everytime** the machine is started or restarted and that can be **accessed from the metadata endpoint also.**

## **Abusing IAM permissions**

Most of the following proposed permissions are **given to the default Compute SA,** the only problem is that the **default access scope prevents the SA from using them**. However, if **`cloud-platform`** **scope** is enabled or just the **`compute`** **scope** is enabled, you will be **able to abuse them**.

Check the following permissions:

* ****[**compute.instances.osLogin**](../../gcp-pentesting/gcp-privilege-escalation/gcp-compute-privesc/#compute.instances.oslogin)****
* ****[**compute.instances.osAdminLogin**](../../gcp-pentesting/gcp-privilege-escalation/gcp-compute-privesc/#compute.instances.osadminlogin)****
* ****[**compute.projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata**](../../gcp-pentesting/gcp-privilege-escalation/gcp-compute-privesc/#compute.projects.setcommoninstancemetadata)****
* ****[**compute.instances.setMetadata**](../../gcp-pentesting/gcp-privilege-escalation/gcp-compute-privesc/#compute.instances.setmetadata)****
* ****[**compute.instances.setIamPolicy**](../../gcp-pentesting/gcp-privilege-escalation/gcp-compute-privesc/#compute.instances.setiampolicy)****

## Search for Keys in the filesystem

It's quite possible that **other users on the same box have been running `gcloud`** commands using an account more powerful than your own. You'll **need local root** to do this.

First, find what `gcloud` config directories exist in users' home folders.

```
sudo find / -name "gcloud"
```

You can manually inspect the files inside, but these are generally the ones with the secrets:

* \~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db
* \~/.config/gcloud/legacy\_credentials/\[ACCOUNT]/adc.json
* \~/.config/gcloud/legacy\_credentials/\[ACCOUNT]/.boto
* \~/.credentials.json

Now, you have the option of looking for clear text credentials in these files or simply copying the entire `gcloud` folder to a machine you control and running `gcloud auth list` to see what accounts are now available to you.
