### Via S3 ACL Access Control

Knowing that several organizations **store sensitive information ins S3 buckets**, maintaining **access to those buckets** might be enough to **maintain persistance inside the organization**.

[**S3 ACL Access Control**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html) is a recognized functionality of AWS in that you can use an access control list to **allow access to S3 buckets from outside your own AWS account** without configuring an Identity-based or Resource-based IAM policy.\
While many organizations may be prepared to alert on S3 buckets made public via resource policy, this alerting may not extend to capabilities associated with bucket or object ACLs. Furthermore, subtler configurations that expose bucket or object resources to other accounts via ACLs may go undetected by organizations, even those with strong alerting capabilities. Using these permissions, you can **extend your access by allowing other AWS accounts you control to read or write objects**, buckets, and bucket ACLs.\
Furthermore, the access can be extended to AUTHENTICATED USERS, which is a term AWS uses to describe any AWS IAM principal in any other AWS account. The access can also be extended to ANY USER which is a term AWS uses to describe anonymous access that does not require authentication.
