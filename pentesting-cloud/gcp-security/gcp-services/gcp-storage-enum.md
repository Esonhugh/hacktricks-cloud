## Storage

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Storage is a **cloud-based storage solution** that provides highly durable and available object storage for unstructured data. It offers **various storage classes** based on performance, availability, and cost, including Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive. GCP Storage also provides advanced features such as **lifecycle policies, versioning, and access control** to manage and secure data effectively.

The bucket can be stored in a region, in 2 regions or **multi-region (default)**.

### Storage Types

* **Standard Storage**: This is the default storage option that **offers high-performance, low-latency access to frequently accessed data**. It is suitable for a wide range of use cases, including serving website content, streaming media, and hosting data analytics pipelines.
* **Nearline Storage**: This storage class offers **lower storage costs** and **slightly higher access costs** than Standard Storage. It is optimized for infrequently accessed data, with a minimum storage duration of 30 days. It is ideal for backup and archival purposes.
* **Coldline Storage**: This storage class is optimized for **long-term storage of infrequently accessed data**, with a minimum storage duration of 90 days. It offers the **lower storage costs** than Nearline Storage, but with **higher access costs.**
* **Archive Storage**: This storage class is designed for cold data that is accessed **very infrequently**, with a minimum storage duration of 365 days. It offers the **lowest storage costs of all GCP storage options** but with the **highest access costs**. It is suitable for long-term retention of data that needs to be stored for compliance or regulatory reasons.
* **Autoclass**: If you **don't know how much you are going to access** the data you can select Autoclass and GCP will **automatically change the type of storage for you to minimize costs**.

### Access Control

By **default** it's **recommended** to control the access via **IAM**, but it's also possible to **enable the use of ACLs**.\
If you select to only use IAM (default) and **90 passes**, you **won't be able to enable ACLs** for the bucket.

### Storage Objects Protection

### Versioning

It's possible to enable versioning, this will **save old versions of the file inside the bucket**. It's possible to configure the **number of versions you want to keep** and even **how long** you want **noncurrent** versions (old versions) to live. Recommended is **7 days for Standard type**.

The **metadata of a noncurrent version is kept**. Moreover, **ACLs of noncurrent versions are also kept**, so the liver version might have different ACLs from the current version.&#x20;

Learn more in the [**docs**](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning).

### Retention Policy

Indicate how **long** you want to **forbid the deletion of Objects inside the bucket** (very useful for compliance at least).\
Only one of **versioning or retention policy can be enabled at the same time**.

### Encryption

By default objects are **encrypted using Google managed keys**, but you could also use a **key from KMS**.

### Enumeration

```bash
# List all storage buckets in project
gsutil ls

# Get each bucket configuration (protections, CLs, times, configs...)
gsutil ls -L

# List contents of a specific bucket
gsutil ls gs://bucket-name/
gsutil ls -r gs://bucket-name/ # Recursive
gsutil ls -a gs://bucket-name/ # Get ALL versions of objects

# Cat the context of a file without copying it locally
gsutil cat 'gs://bucket-name/folder/object'
gsutil cat 'gs://bucket-name/folder/object#<num>' # cat specific version

# Copy an object from the bucket to your local storage for review
gsutil cp gs://bucket-name/folder/object ~/

# List using a raw OAuth token
## Useful because "CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN" and "gcloud config set auth/access_token_file" doesn't work with gsutil
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/<storage-name>/o"
# Download file content from bucket
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/supportstorage-58249/o/flag.txt?alt=media" --output -
```

If you get a permission denied error listing buckets you may still have access to the content. So, now that you know about the name convention of the buckets you can generate a list of possible names and try to access them:

```bash
for i in $(cat wordlist.txt); do gsutil ls -r gs://"$i"; done
```

### Public Access

It's possible to give external users (logged in GCP or not) access to buckets content. However, by default bucket will have disabled the option to expose publicly a bucket:

```bash
# Disable public prevention
gcloud storage buckets update gs://BUCKET_NAME --no-public-access-prevention

# Make all objects in a bucket public
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://BUCKET_NAME --member=allUsers --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
## I don't think you can make specific objects public just with IAM

# Make a bucket or object public (via ACL)
gcloud storage buckets update gs://BUCKET_NAME --add-acl-grant=entity=AllUsers,role=READER
gcloud storage objects update gs://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_NAME --add-acl-grant=entity=AllUsers,role=READER
```

If you try to give **ACLs to a bucket with disabled ACLs** you will find this error: `ERROR: HTTPError 400: Cannot use ACL API to update bucket policy when uniform bucket-level access is enabled. Read more at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access`

To access open buckets via browser, access the URL `https://<bucket_name>.storage.googleapis.com/` or `https://<bucket_name>.storage.googleapis.com/<object_name>`

### Privilege Escalation

In the following page you can check how to **abuse storage permissions to escalate privileges**:

{% content-ref url="../gcp-privilege-escalation/gcp-storage-privesc.md" %}
[gcp-storage-privesc.md](../gcp-privilege-escalation/gcp-storage-privesc.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Search Open Buckets in Current Account

With the following script [gathered from here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/gcp\_misc/-/blob/master/find\_open\_buckets.sh) you can find all the open buckets:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

############################
# Run this tool to find buckets that are open to the public anywhere
# in your GCP organization.
#
# Enjoy!
############################

for proj in $(gcloud projects list --format="get(projectId)"); do
    echo "[*] scraping project $proj"
    for bucket in $(gsutil ls -p $proj); do
        echo "    $bucket"
        ACL="$(gsutil iam get $bucket)"

        all_users="$(echo $ACL | grep allUsers)"
        all_auth="$(echo $ACL | grep allAuthenticatedUsers)"

        if [ -z "$all_users" ]
        then
              :
        else
              echo "[!] Open to all users: $bucket"
        fi

        if [ -z "$all_auth" ]
        then
              :
        else
              echo "[!] Open to all authenticated users: $bucket"
        fi
    done
done
```
